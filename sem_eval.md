### SemEval-2015 Task 17:Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation (TExEval)

- three main subtasks:
	- term extraction
	- relation discovery
	- taxonomy construction
- most approaches for **relation discovery** from text rely on 
	- ***lexico-syntactic patterns***
	- ***co-occurrence information***
	- ***substring inclusion***
	- ***exploit semantic relations provided in textual definitions***
- several methods to evaluate the taxonomy quality
	- manual evaluation by domain experts
	- structural evaluation 
	- automatic evaluation against a gold standard
- structural analysis
	- performed by computing the cardinality of Vs and Es
- comparison against **gold standard**
	- use the **Bs,g** measure
- manual quality assessments

- submitted runs
	- 6 teams
- results(***not read***)

- discussion

- conclusion
	- most systems focused on the relation extraction subtask against the taxonomy construction
